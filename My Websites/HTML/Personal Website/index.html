	<!-- Heres how you write paragraphs-->
	<p> Heelloooooooo! Nick Shields here. This is my very first personal website that I have made from scratch. <br />
	As you can see, right now, it's very basic but as I continue to progress and learn more about HTML, it <em> should </em> improve :) 
	<br /> Hopefully, by the end of this week, this site will be completely renovated and look amazing... No promises though</p>

	<br /> playing sports to watching hardcore porography, I am a very well rounded person.</p>
